A Hashing-based Graph Library
=============================

This library was originally intended to be a more current implementation of Haskell's FGL:
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl),
[GitHub](https://github.com/haskell/fgl),
[Original Site](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/fgl/haskell/).

It exports a very similar interface to the old library, but has been changed in
a few places to be closer to other container libraries. It also tries to be
more uniform in its inputs and outputs.

I aim to maintain high-quality tests and documentation, high performance,
and a reasonably low memory profile. If any of those seem to be lacking, let me
know.
