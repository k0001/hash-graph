A New *F*unctional *G*raph *L*ibrary for Haskell
================================================

This library is intended to be a more current implementation of Haskell's FGL:
[Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fgl),
[GitHub](https://github.com/haskell/fgl),
[Original Site](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/fgl/haskell/).

The main goals of this rewrite are increased performance and a nicer API.
If the performance is not better, this rewrite is failing. As for the API, I
personally did not like some of the design and thought I would take a crack at
changing it closer to my liking.

I hope to maintain high quality tests, benchmarks, profiling, and documentation.
Shout if any seem to be lacking.
